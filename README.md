## About The Project

Writing a press release is more than just filling in a template. The language needs to be clear, the headline impactful, and the formatting perfect. "The Lede" was built to bridge the gap between static templates and expensive PR software.

It's a simple, elegant tool that not only generates a professionally structured press release but also acts as your personal editor, providing real-time feedback to help you improve your copy before you even hit "generate".

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive Interface:** A clean, dark-mode UI designed for focus.
*   **Instant Generation:** Fill out the form and see your formatted press release appear instantly.
*   **Intelligent Linter:** Get real-time suggestions on:
    *   Headline length for better impact.
    *   Commonly used buzzwords and jargon to avoid.
*   **Copy-to-Clipboard:** A one-click button to copy your final press release.
*   **No Backend Needed:** Runs entirely in your browser, ensuring your data stays private.
